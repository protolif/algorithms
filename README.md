# Algorithms
Algorithm challenges in Ruby
Brain-teasers
For fun
:)

Maybe a utility library will arise from it
No promises

This is purely for the enjoyment of problem solving
Through Ruby code

Perhaps 10 minutes a day is recommended
No commitment, no guilt

Perhaps a good way to start the day
To put the brain in a creative mode
instead of a consumptive one
